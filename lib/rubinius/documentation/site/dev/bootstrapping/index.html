      <h1 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h1>

<p>Bootstrapping is the process of building up functionality of the system until
all Ruby code can be executed. There are seven stages to the bootstrap process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>VM: The virtual machine is able to load and execute bytecode, send
messages (i.e. look up and execute methods), and all primitive functions
are available, but not yet hooked up as Ruby methods.</p>

    <p>The Class class has to be manually set up this early in the process by
setting its class to be itself and its superclass to be Module. In
addition to Class and Module, a couple of other base classes are created
here including Object, Tuple, LookupTable, and MethodTable.</p>

    <p>Now that classes can be defined, 35 or so built in classes are told to
initialize themselves, symbols for top level methods (:object_id, :call,
:protected, etc) are created, basic exceptions are defined, and
primitives are registered. Finally IO gets hooked up. Also at this stage,
several fundamental Ruby methods are bound to primitives.</p>

    <p>At this point there is enough defined behavior to begin to load up the
rest of the runtime kernel which is all defined in ruby. This has to be
done in several passes as the language grows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alpha: This starts the loading of Ruby code. The ability to open classes
and modules and define methods exists. The minimum functionality to
support the following methods is implemented in kernel/alpha.rb:</p>

    <p>attr_reader :sym
  attr_writer :sym
  attr_accessor :sym
  private :sym
  protected :sym
  module_function :sym
  include mod</p>

    <p>Also, it is possible to raise exceptions and cause the running process to
exit. This stage lays the foundation for the next two stages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bootstrap: This stage continues to add the minimum functionality to
support loading platform and common. The primitive functions are added
for most of the kernel classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>platform: The FFI (foreign function interface) system is implemented and
Ruby method interfaces to platform-specific functions are created.  Once
this is set up, platform specific things such as pointers, file access,
math, and POSIX commands are attached.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>common: The vast majority of the Ruby core library classes are
implemented. The Ruby core classes are kept as implementation-neutral as
possible. Also, most of the functionality for Rubinius specific classes
is added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>delta: Final versions of methods like #attr_reader, etc. are added. Also,
implementation-specific versions of methods that override the versions
provided in common are added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loader: The compiled version of kernel/loader.rb is run.</p>

    <p>The final stage setups the life cycle of a ruby process. It starts by
connecting the VM to the system, sets up load paths, and reads
customization scripts from the home directory. It traps signals, and
processes command line arguments.</p>

    <p>After that, it either runs the script passed to it from the command line
or boots up the interactive ruby shell. When that finishes, it runs any
at_exit blocks that had been registered, finalizes all objects, and
exits.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="">Load Order</h2>

<p>The files in the kernel directories bootstrap, platform, common, and delta,
implement the respective bootstrapping stages above. The order in
which these directories are loaded is specified in runtime/index.</p>

<p>When an rbc file is loaded, code at the script level and in class or module
bodies is executed. For instance, when loading</p>

<pre><code>class SomeClass
  attr_accessor :value
end
</code></pre>

<p>the call to #attr_accessor will be run. This requires that any code called
in script, class, or module bodies must be loaded before the file that calls
the code is loaded. The kernel/alpha.rb defines most of the code that will be
needed at the script or module level. However, other load order dependencies
exist between some of the platform, common, delta, and compiler files.</p>

<p>These load order dependencies are addressed by the load_order.txt file located
in each of the kernel/** directories. If you modify code that adds a load
order dependency, you must edit the load_order.txt files to place the depended
on file above the file that depends on it. Also, if you add a new file to one
of the kernel directories, you must add the file name to the load_order.txt
file in that directory. These files are copied to the appropriate runtime/**
directories during build. During each of the bootstrap stages above, the VM
loads the files listed in load_order.txt in order.</p>
