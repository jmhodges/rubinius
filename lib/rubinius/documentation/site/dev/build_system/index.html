<p>TODO: Many details are missing.</p>

<p>Rubinius uniformly uses Rake as the build system for its own files. However
Rubinius also includes the source for several external libraries and these
typically use makefiles.</p>

<h2 id="">Development versus Install Builds</h2>

<p>Rubinius is comprised of the executable and various support files like the core
and standard libraries. The executable needs to know where to find these files
even if moved to a different location. To handle this problem, Rubinius
distinguishes two build types: development and install. The executable stores
the full path to its base directory, relative to which it expects to find the
files it needs.</p>

<p>The development executable stores the path to the source directory in which it
was built. You can then move the executable to a different location but as you
make changes to the core library files in the kernel/** directories, the
executable will continue to use those files.</p>

<p>The install executable stores the path to the install directory. Again, even if
the executable is moved to a new location, it will continue to find the
installed files.</p>

<p>This has consequences, of course. If you build a development executable and then
rename your source directory, you will need to rebuild. Likewise, if you build an
install executable and rename the install directory, the executable will <em>not</em>
function, <em>even if the executable is in the directory</em>. The executable checks a
single, hard-coded path. If this ends up being very painful for some reason,
we&rsquo;ll revise it.</p>

<h2 id="">Installing Rubinius</h2>

<p>To install Rubinius, you must first configure it with an install prefix:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir
</code></pre>

<p>The configure process creates a &lsquo;config.rb&rsquo; file that specifies the key file
paths that Rubinius uses. Once configured, run &lsquo;rake install&rsquo; to build and
install. The install procedure builds all the files, including compiling the
Ruby standard library files in the lib/ directory, then copies them into the
install location using the &lsquo;install&rsquo; program. The install tasks are located in
rakelib/install.rake.</p>
